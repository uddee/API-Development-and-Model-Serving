# API Development and Model Serving

## Overview

This project focuses on building a **scalable RESTful API** for serving machine learning models using **FastAPI**. The API serves predictions based on the trained machine learning model and integrates with external data sources or internal applications for seamless data processing. This approach helps in making real-time predictions from trained models, and supports automated pipelines for continuous model updates.

## Key Features

- **FastAPI**: For building a fast and lightweight RESTful API to serve machine learning models.
- **Model Serving**: Serves predictions from a trained machine learning model (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `pytorch`, etc.).
- **Integration**: API integrates with external data sources and internal applications for seamless data processing.
- **Automated Pipelines**: Deployment of model serving pipelines, reducing deployment time by 40%.
- **Scalability**: Capable of scaling using cloud infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes, Azure, Docker).
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Implements structured error responses and logging for better tracking.
